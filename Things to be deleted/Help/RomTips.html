<p><b><font color="#008000" face="Trebuchet MS">Distribution</font></b><font face="Trebuchet MS"><br>
I do not assert that the following is perfectly accurate and it is not
intended to be used as legal advice, nor does it condone any specific actions or
behavior. Ensuring that your actions are legal is
solely your own responsibility. That being said, these guidelines should give you
an idea as to a good way to distribute your modified ROM.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">The NES game, Metroid, is a copyrighted work by
Nintendo and is illegal to distribute, in part or in whole, to anybody who does
not own an original and legally obtained copy of the game. (Due to recent
litigation the simple act of making the copyrighted work <i>available</i> to
those that do not legitimately own it may be considered illegal, even if the
file is ultimately not copied illegally.) This does not mean that you can not
distribute your own edited worlds. The <b>changes </b>made to the game are
intellectual property created by you and you legally own the copyright to the <b>new
data</b> that was added to the ROM. The recommended way to distribute a modified
ROM is to use an IPS utility to create an IPS patch. The IPS utility examines an
original copy of the ROM and your modified ROM and identifies differences in
data, creating a patch that contains only the changes you've made, and excluding
any original (copyrighted) material. The recipients of the patch then use an IPS
utility, in conjunction with an original (presumably legally obtained) ROM, to
reproduce your customized version of the game. (An analogy could be made between
distributing an IPS patch and distributing a mod for a more current game: you
don't distribute the game, only the mod.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Before creating an IPS patch, it is also
recommended that the ROM be saved <i>without</i> map data (unless you intend for
other users to open the ROM in Editroid). Look under <img src="Check.gif" align="bottom" width="16" height="16">Options</font><font face="Wingdings">à</font><font face="Trebuchet MS">Maps.
If the &quot;Save To ROM&quot; option is selected, change it to &quot;Save To
External File.&quot; Open the ROM if it is not already open. Now, save them ROM.
The map data will be excluded from the ROM and placed in an external file.
Once you have obtained a copy of the ROM without map data you may set the option
back to &quot;Save To ROM&quot; if you prefer.</font></p>
<p><b><font color="#008000" face="Trebuchet MS">Red Doors</font></b><font face="Trebuchet MS"><br>
One of the things you will probably notice early on
is that when you add new red doors (the doors that have to be opened with
missiles) the doors will not remain open like the pre-existing red doors. You
need to update the game's password data (see <i>Password Data Editor</i> under <i>Editors</i>)
so that the status of these doors will be stored in the password.</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">There are also other considerations with red doors.
It is important to make both sides of a door the same color. If one side is red
and the other is blue then the door will not work properly. You are also limited in the number of red doors you can place since there is only a limited
amount of password data to work with (although you may find the behavior of a
red door without associated password data to be acceptable). </font></p>
<p><b><font color="#008000" face="Trebuchet MS">Enemy Slots</font></b><font face="Trebuchet MS"><br>
Enemy slot assignment is important; poorly
orchestrated enemy slot assignments will probably result in enemies not
appearing where you want them when you want them. Certain enemies might not ever
appear at all. The reason is while the game is being played, there are six
&quot;slots&quot; (numbered from zero to five) allocated for enemy data. When enemies placed
on the map are scrolled into view in the game, they aren't simply assigned to a
free slot. Instead, the slot is defined statically and when the enemy is
scrolled into view, if its slot is taken, the enemy simply won't appear.</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">There is no single rule that can be followed to
ensure that all the enemies appear when you want them, but there are some
general guidelines to help things work out more like you planned. One technique
used in the original game is to repeat a single screen (or multiple screens with
similar enemy setups) with a large number of enemies filling most slots. As the
player goes through the screens the enemies may appear to be random since a
number of factors are involved when it comes to which slots will already be
taken. You may also want to designate a &quot;reserved&quot; enemy slot that
will be used sparingly. When you want to guarantee that a specific enemy will
appear, it can use this reserved slot that will usually be free.</font></p>
<p><b><font color="#008000" face="Trebuchet MS">Palettes</font></b><font face="Trebuchet MS"><br>
When editing background palettes you have a lot of
freedom; do whatever looks nice. There are some things to keep in mind, though.
You may notice that by default the first color in every palette is black. This
color can be changed, but the first color should be the same for <i>all palettes</i>.
This is necessary due to the technical implementation details of palettes on the
NES. (For those who are curious, the NES &quot;mirrors&quot; the first color for
each palette, meaning that the first palette entry is shared between all
palettes. This means that when a palette is loaded into the NES video memory,
the first color of that palette overwrites the first color of all other
palettes, so all palettes will have the same first color as the most recently
loaded palette, which can result in undesirable or unpredictable results.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">You also need to make considerations for palette
swaps. For levels with two sets of palettes, each set should probably have at
least one corresponding identical palette. The room where the palette swap
occurs&nbsp; should contain only objects that use the palette (or palettes) that
is common to both sets. Otherwise the transition won't be seamless: colors in
the room will suddenly change when the player walks through the door. A similar
consideration is the palette used for elevators. The elevator screens should use
the same palette number in all levels.</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">When editing sprite palettes, keep in mind that
palettes are shared between doors, enemies, Samus, and the life/missile display,
and that certain palettes will be updated and overwritten when the player
switches to missiles, gets the varia suit, or becomes suitless Samus. </font></p>
