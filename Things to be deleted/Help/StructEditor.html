<font face="Trebuchet MS"><img src="StructWindow.png" align="right" width="700" height="400">The
structure editor, found under the &quot;Special Tools&quot; menu, edits the
components that the game's screens are constructed from.</font>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS"><b><font color="#008000">Tiles</font></b><br>
Tiles are small graphics with associated &quot;physics&quot; (solid, breakable,
and air). Four of these are put together to create a combo.</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS"><b><font color="#008000">Combos</font></b><br>
Combos are the building block of
&quot;structures,&quot; or the objects that are used to fill the screen. They
can be edited by selecting a tile from the tile selector, then holding shift and
using the left mouse button to draw in the combo editor. Any changes made in the
combo editor will be reflected in <i>all structures that contain that combo</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS"><b><font color="#008000">Structures</font></b><br>
These are the building blocks of screens, each composed of several combos. To
edit a structure, first click on the combo editor to select a combo. Then, click
in the structure editor to paint with the selected combo. You may also
right-click on the structure for a menu that allows changes to be made to the
shape of the structure.</font></p>
