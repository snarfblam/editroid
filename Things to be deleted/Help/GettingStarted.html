<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">The first thing you will need in order to use
Editroid is an NES ROM image for the game Metroid. It is your responsibility to
legally obtain a ROM image. You will also need to go to the file's properties and make sure the file
is not set as read-only (most ROM files are distributed as read-only).</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Once you open Editroid, the first thing to do is open a ROM for editing (click the <img src="Open.gif" width="16" height="16">Open
button on the toolbar), but remember: it is always a good idea to
make a backup of the original. Once you've opened the ROM you can begin editing
the game. The main window is depicted
below.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Each button on the toolbar has a tool tip that identifies its function. If
that function has a keyboard shortcut it is shown in the tool tip in
parentheses.</font></p>

<p><b><font color="#008000" face="Trebuchet MS">Screen Editor</font></b><font face="Trebuchet MS"><img src="MainWindow.png" align="right" width="540" height="396"><br>
The screen editor is the most important feature in the program. Screens are
edited by selecting objects and modifying them. When a background
object is selected it will appear in bright colors.
When an enemy is selected a rectangle will appear around it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Objects can be moved by dragging them around or by using the arrow keys. They
can be modified using the toolbar buttons or the keyboard: use the plus and
minus keys to change the type of an object, use the home and end keys to
re-order items, and the &quot;p&quot; key to change the color of an object. With
enemies the difficulty of the enemy changes with its colors.</font></p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">The &quot;object info&quot; provides information about what you are currently
editing: The object type icon
(<img src="object.gif">) indicates the type of the currently selected object or enemy. The types
available depend on the level you are editing. The palette icon (<img src="Pal.gif" width="16" height="16">)
indicates the palette the object is being displayed with. The &quot;slot&quot;
icon (<img src="Namespace.gif" width="16" height="16">) indicates which &quot;sprite
slot&quot; an enemy belongs to; when a screen is loaded, if a sprite slot is
already taken, an enemy belonging to that slot will not be loaded. An enemies
sprite slot can be changed by clicking on the sprite slot icon.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">To the right of the object info is the index of the
screen being displayed (in the case of the illustration, layout #9 is showing). It is important to understand that you are
limited to a certain number of pre-defined screens which must be re-used to fill
out the map. Use the <img src="PrevScreen.gif">Previous Screen and <img src="NextScreen.gif">Next
Screen
buttons (or the page up and page down keys) to cycle through the
available screens for the level you are currently editing.&nbsp;</font> </p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">To the right of the screen index is the free memory
(in bytes). This is level-specific, i.e. memory can not be freed in one level to
use in another. The original Metroid ROM does not have any free memory. Memory
can be freed by deleting objects and enemies from screens.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS"><b><font color="#008000">Editor Ma</font></b><font color="#008000"><b>p<br>
</b></font>The editor map is used to navigate the map while
you edit. Click on the editor map to center the view in that spot. You
can also navigate the map by holding shift and using the arrow keys.</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">As you edit the game you might want to change the
layout of the map. Understand that the map you see in Editroid is for <i> editing purposes
only</i>.
Changing this map does not generally change levels in the game. The game
determines which level each screen represents as you walk from room to room.
Data for different levels is only loaded when the player uses an elevator. The Editroid map simply aids you in editing and
tells the editor which
level's data to load for each screen. The map is referred to as the &quot;editor
map&quot; because it is
used by the editor only.</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">If you want to change the layout of the map you
generally need change the editor map. Right-clicking a screen on the map will
delete it. During game play the screen will not scroll into areas where there is
no screen.
Holding shift and using the left mouse button, you can paint on the map with the
color of the square you initially clicked on. Using shift and right-clicking
will cycle an individual map square through all the levels. You can also use the
number pad to modify the map.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="#FF0000">Metedit</font></b><font face="Trebuchet MS"><font color="#FF0000"><br>
Metedit</font> is a Metroid
level editor that may have some features that Editroid does not. If you wish to use
the two editors in conjunction there are some considerations you need to keep in
mind. Firstly, <font color="#008000">Editroid</font> saves some extra data in
the ROM file. This extra data does not affect any tested emulators, however <font color="#FF0000">Metedit</font>
is more finicky and requires that a ROM be exactly the correct size. In order to
save a ROM file without this extra data, go to the options menu and, under
&quot;Maps,&quot; select &quot;Save To External File.&quot; Also, Editroid's map
files and <font color="#FF0000">Metedit</font>'s map files are not compatible.</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">It is also suggested that a ROM only be open in one
editor at once. If a ROM is opened in two editors simultaneously then every time
you save with one editor, any changes made with the other will be overwritten
and undone.</font></p>
