Editor<br>
</b></font>The item editor is an advanced editing feature.
Understanding how the ROM stores items internally may make using this editor
easier. In the ROM item data is stored per-level. For each level there are a
list of &quot;map row entries.&quot; Each of these entries defines all of the items on
a row of the map (there can not be more than one such entry per row). Each item data entry
contains one or more &quot;map room entries,&quot; which define all of the items in
a room (typically, there is only one item in a room).</font>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">To move items around on the map, click on a map
room entry
and drag it around with the mouse. Note that when you move an item up and down,
all other items in the same map row entry move vertically with it. All items in
a map row entry are tied together so that they must all appear on the same row. Also note
that you can not drag map room entries past each other in the same map row entry. In the
current version of Editroid, this limitation is imposed for technical reasons.</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">To edit the items in a screen, click a map room
entry. The screen you clicked will be displayed on the bottom. Two boxes
appear on the right. The top box lists all of the items in the screen (although there is
only one item in most screens) and the bottom box lists options for the selected
item.
There are different kinds of items: elevators, palette swaps, power-ups, and
even doors and enemies. In the current version of Editroid, you can not change
item data from one type to another.</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">There is also a checkbox labeled &quot;Update
password data.&quot; When this is checked, the ROM's password data is updated to reflect
changes made to item data. This allows you to move and change power-ups and
still have the password system work properly. If you prefer to manage password
data yourself through the Password Data Editor, uncheck this box.</font></p>
