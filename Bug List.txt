- Advanced palette editor does not stay above other windows when another window is selected.  
  Mostly an issue when you click the screen editing window and the advanced palette editor 
  window falls under it.  At that point you need to move the main editing window out of the
  way to get to it.
- CHR animation editor.  Any free frames appear to be automatically assigned to Ridley when
  you close the editor and save the rom/ reopen.  I haven’t tried to recreate it yet but
  it’s not a big deal, I can just delete the frames as needed before allocating them where 
  I need them.(edited)
